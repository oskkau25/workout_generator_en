# Workout Generator - Bug Report & Fixes

## üêõ Bugs Found and Fixed

### 1. **Critical File Structure Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The original HTML file was malformed with escaped HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`) wrapped in paragraph tags, making it unreadable by browsers.

**Fix**: Recreated the entire HTML file with proper structure and formatting.

### 2. **Missing API Key** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES USER ACTION
**Problem**: The Gemini API key was empty, causing AI integration to fail.
```javascript
const apiKey = ""; // Original - empty
```

**Fix**: Added placeholder with clear instructions:
```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"; // User must add their API key
```

**Action Required**: Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key.

### 3. **Potential Logic Issues** ‚úÖ IMPROVED
**Problem**: The duration calculation assumed 1 exercise per minute, which might not be realistic for all exercises.

**Fix**: Added better fallback logic and improved exercise selection algorithm.

### 4. **Image Error Handling** ‚úÖ ADDED
**Problem**: No fallback for broken exercise images.

**Fix**: Added `onerror` handler to display placeholder images when exercise images fail to load.
